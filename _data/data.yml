career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: 
        I’m a cognitive science researcher interested in understanding how brains and machines encode and process information. 
        Humans possess the ability to seamlessly make sense of a diverse array of visual stimuli, and generalize exisiting 
        knowledege to new situations. On the other hand, current large-scale deep learning models exhibit certain human-like 
        behaviors after training on massive datasets. My passion lies in studying the similarities and differences between 
        the representations and behaviors of these two systems.
